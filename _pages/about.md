I am currently a third-year PhD student in the [Immunity and Transmission lab at IDMIT (CEA)](https://jacob.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/Pages/Departements/IDMIT/laboratoires/Laboratoire-Immunite-Transmission-LIT.aspx), under the supervision of [Marc Labetoulle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKlpBSgAAAAJ&hl=fr), [Antoine Rousseau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oyxQPJwAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Oscar Haigh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-Oh2GceV0y0C&hl=en).

My research focuses on T-cell responses associated with protection against HSV1 reactivation in an HSV1 oro-ocular mouse model.

Beyond academics, I enjoy reading, fiber arts and drawing.
